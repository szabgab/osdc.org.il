As a developer of a web application, or as the manager of a company with a web application, let me ask
a question:

<b>Can you sleep at night?</b>

Are you sure your application still works? Will it also work after the next urgent change?

Can you afford a team of people who will test the whole application after every change?

Thoroughly testing a web application can be very time consuming. Doing it again, and again after each change
is impossible.

Unless it is automated.

In this talk you are going to learn how to use <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> to make you sleep better.
