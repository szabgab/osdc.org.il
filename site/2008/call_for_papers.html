<h1><a name="call_for_papers">Call for Papers</a></h1>
<p>Papers on open source development tools, languages and technologies are
solicited for submission to OSDC Israel 2008. We're interested in a wide 
range of open source technologies and languages - when submitting a paper,
please feel free to select 'Other' if none of the listed categories
fit. For some examples, take a look at some previous presentations at
<a href="http://osdc.org.il/2006/presentations.html">http://osdc.org.il/2006/presentations.html</a>.</p>
<p>Please visit the home page for a list of key dates:
<a href="http://osdc.org.il/">http://osdc.org.il/</a>.</p>
<p>We've tried to include a range of streams for papers - please
select all that apply. If you think we've missed something obvious,
please let us know! You can contact the conference organizers at
<em><a href="mailto:organizers@osdc.org.il">organizers@osdc.org.il</a></em></p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="instructions_for_presenters">Instructions for Presenters</a></h2>
<p><strong>All presentations (except lightning talks) must be accompanied by
presentation materials</strong>. These may be as simple as submitting the slides
you intend to present, although a detailed paper complementing your talk
matter would be preferred.</p>
<p>Failure to submit a paper may result in speaker benefits being withdrawn.</p>
<p>Classes and auditoriums include a projector and either a flip-board or a
white-board. You are expected to provide your own laptop. If you require
any additional presentational aids please contact us in advance.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="presentation_formats">Presentation formats</a></h2>
<p>We will accept the following types of presentation:</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="lightning_talks__5_minutes_">Lightning Talks (5 minutes)</a></h3>
<p>You don't need to submit a proposal for a lightning talk. These will be
organised a few weeks prior to the conference. Instructions will be
posted on the news page, please stay tuned for updates.</p>
<p>Lightning talks are brief talks that focus on a single example, idea,
project or technique. Lightning talks are not expected to cover all
aspects of the subject. They're an excellent forum for first-time
speakers.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="short__20_minutes__and_standard__40_minutes_">Short (20 minutes) and Standard (40 minutes)</a></h3>
<p>This is the preferred format. This is enough time to cover a few issues
well and allows us to provide a good selection of talks throughout
the day.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="long__90_minutes_">Long (90 minutes)</a></h3>
<p>Long talks are ideal for experienced speakers who want to cover a large
topic.</p>
<p>If you choose the longer time slot please include include a justification
in your proposal. We reserve the right to ask you to change a long talk
proposal to be a standard length instead.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="submission_stages">Submission stages</a></h2>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="1__proposals">1. Proposals</a></h3>
<p>Your proposal will need to include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_info">your name and a bit of bio info (include a bit about your qualifications regarding your presentation topic)</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="item_name_of_talk">name of talk</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="item_presentation">a really brief summary of the presentation (around 30 words)</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="item_cover">a description of what you expect to cover (around 200 words)</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="item_interest">who your talk is likely to interest (some keywords)</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="item_talk">likely topic of talk (track)</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="item_name_and_bio_information_of_any_co_2dauthors">name and bio information of any co-authors</a></strong>

<li><strong><a name="item_language_the_talk_will_be_presented_in">language the talk will be presented in</a></strong>

</ul>
<p>Don't panic. We don't require you to have written the technology that
you want to talk about. If you use something in your day to day working
life and you think that other people might benefit from using it, then
feel free to propose a talk on it.</p>
<p>To submit a proposal, please use the proposal submission form that
will be placed on <a href="http://osdc.org.il/2008/">http://osdc.org.il/2008/</a>.  You will need to log in,
or create an account if you don't have one already (instructions are 
going to be on that page).</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="2__proposals_acceptance">2. Proposals acceptance</a></h3>
<p>Authors will be notified of the acceptance of their proposal by the
proposal acceptance date. Obviously we'd love to accept as many proposals
as we can, but we only have a certain number of sessions to fill.</p>
<p>If you require faster confirmation of acceptance (for example, because you
are traveling from overseas and require extra time to make arrangements)
please communicate this to the organizers when submitting your proposal.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="3__paper_submission">3. Paper Submission</a></h3>
<p><strong>All presenters are required to submit presentation materials by the
specified date.  Failure to do so may result in loss of your speaking
slot and speaker benefits.</strong></p>
<p>Speakers have the option of submitting either a paper or slides with
speaker notes. Papers are preferred.</p>
<p>This submission is to be your final version, not a draft. A paper
submission should contain all of the usual aspects of a paper such as
an abstract, introduction, body and conclusion. Please ensure that this
submission has had its grammar and spelling corrected and that code
snippets work.</p>
<p>Your paper allows attendees who attended your talk a chance to refresh
their memories about your presentation, and gives attendees who missed
your talk a chance to learn from you anyway. Make sure your paper includes
- at the very least - a brief introduction to your subject material and
a list of further resources.</p>
<p>We would prefer that papers for standard length talks (20 minutes) be
no more than 4 A4 pages of 11-point type with reasonable margins and
papers for long talks (45 minutes) be no more than 8 pages. Appropriate
file formats include any file that can be read with Open Office (which
includes plain text and HTML with minimal mark-up), or POD. Slides
(even those accompanied by speaker notes) may also be printed in the
proceedings, but we cannot perform special formatting for you.</p>
<p>By submitting a paper to be published in the proceedings, you are agreeing
to the OSDC Publication Agreement. (The agreement will be published later,
as a minimum you agree to publish your paper on the web site of OSDC 
www.osdc.org.il and in the proceedings published by the conference.)</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="4__review_results">4. Review results</a></h3>
<p>All papers will be reviewed. The purpose of review is to ensure that
papers are of a high quality and to aid our talk scheduling. The
purpose is not to identify spelling or grammatical errors or to test
code snippets, although errors may be corrected during the review if
found. Obviously, we'd strongly recommend you ask a friend or colleague
to give your paper a read through before you submit it.</p>
<p>Once your paper has been reviewed, the review results will be provided
to you so that you can make the requested improvements for the published
version.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="5__proceedings_version">5. Proceedings version</a></h3>
<p>This is the final copy of your paper as it will be printed in the
conference proceedings.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="speaker_benefits">Speaker Benefits</a></h2>
<p>All OSDC speakers (except for lightning talks) at OSDC will have their
conference registration fee waived.</p>
<p>Note that it's important that you get your papers in by the due dates -
we reserve the right to withdraw the free registration if you don't get
it in on time. If you're having problems meeting the deadlines, please let
us know as soon as possible so that we can work with you to figure it out.</p>
<p>If you're a student, please make sure that we know it. We may offer
<code>prize(s)</code> for the best student paper submitted.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="contact_details">Contact details</a></h2>
<p>If you have any questions, please contact the OSDC organizers
at <em><a href="mailto:organizers@osdc.org.il">organizers@osdc.org.il</a></em></p>
<p>Further information about the conference, how to write proposals, what
we mean by various words etc. can be found in Frequently Asked Questions.
TBD.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="tracks_list">Tracks List</a></h2>
<p>These are the streams suggested by the proposal system. Select as many
as are appropriate for your proposal. If your technology or language
isn't listed, don't despair! Select 'Other' and include a note in your
proposal about what <code>topic(s)</code> you think would be best.</p>
